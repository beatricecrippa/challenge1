README is very clear and contains detailed instruction and information.
Good use of GitHub!

Avoid the file helper.hpp and divide the utilities implemented inside of that by their purpose.
You can use methods of the std::library for more efficient operations between vectors.
Avoid allocating vectors inside loops.

Good use of the template functions for the choice of the methods.

Well done!
